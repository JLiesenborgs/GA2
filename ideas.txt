Some things to consider:
 - niching
 - some further feedback from fitness calculation, like scale factor in
   lensing GA
   - adjust genome based on this
 - further structure on population? do use some kind of proximity?
 - fewer children than population size, replace some of the parent population
 - selection like in own GA, based on sorted population and prob factor beta
 - fitness proportionate selection
 - representations/crossover for permutations
 - generational model/steady state model/mating pool 

Example problems:
 - Beam from Keane 1996
 - Eight Queens problem
 - Knapsack problem
 - graph k-colouring problem
 - moving optimum ES
