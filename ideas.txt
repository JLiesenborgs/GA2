Population:
 - List/vector Individuals

Individual:
 - Genome/Chromosome/Representation
 - Fitness (Set to Unknown or some fitness measures)
  - Number of components, each component known/unknown?
 - How to serialize these? MPI only?
  - some construction to allow scatter/gather? Genome would use a memory
    context, from which it would get pointers for data? Similar for Fitness?

PopulationFitnessCalculation: MPI, threads, OpenCL/Async
 - multiple populations possible

IndividualFitnessCalculation:
 - sync/async (OpenCL?)
 - start on new generation; some context?

SortedPopulation:
 - single fitness sort, non-dominated sets

PopulationCrossover:
 - takes SortedPopulation as input, produces new population as output
 - selects individuals to be combined -> how many?
 - append to population? To allow cloning?
GenomeCrossover:
 - combines two or more genomes 

PopulationMutation:
 - determine which genomes need mutation

GenomeMutation:
 - apply mutation to genome

GeneticAlgorithm (DefaultGeneticAlgorithm)

 - initialize population
 - calculate fitness 
 - loop:
   - sort
    - sorted population callback
    - abstract sort and new population? parent selection instead?
   - update best, check if done 
   - newpopulation, clone & crossover, mutations
   - calculate fitness
   - prune (if crossover creates too many, keep best? keep random?)

basic process:
 - init = create initial pop
 - calc fitness
 - loop:
  - create new population
  - calc fitness

-> in core Evolutionary Alg:
 - initPop & updatePop step functions
 - Externally, fitness calc should then be called
  - this way, it's easy to create separate versions for mpi/non-mpi

-> some kind of geneticalgstep function/class?


Some things to consider:
 - age of individual
 - more than two parents
 - niching
 - some further feedback from fitness calculation, like scale factor in
   lensing GA
   - adjust genome based on this
 - further structure on population? do use some kind of proximity?
 - fewer children than population size, replace some of the parent population
 - selection like in own GA, based on sorted population and prob factor beta
 - fitness proportionate selection
 - representations/crossover for permutations
 - generational model/steady state model/mating pool 

Example problems:
 - Beam from Keane 1996
 - Eight Queens problem
 - Knapsack problem
 - graph k-colouring problem
 - moving optimum ES
